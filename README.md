## Vision

SwarmOS reimagines the fundamental relationship between computers and users. Instead of waiting for commands, SwarmOS creates an intelligent, proactive computing environment that anticipates needs, optimizes performance, and adapts to changing conditions autonomously.

Traditional operating systems are reactive - they wait for user input or system events before taking action. SwarmOS breaks this paradigm by implementing distributed artificial intelligence that constantly learns, predicts, and optimizes system behavior. Our mission is to create computers that work alongside you, not just for you.

## Architecture

SwarmOS is built on a foundation of distributed AI agents that work together to create an intelligent computing environment:

- **Core Agent Network**: Manages system resources and optimization
- **Learning Subsystem**: Adapts to user behavior and system patterns
- **Security Mesh**: Provides proactive threat detection and response
- **Resource Optimizer**: Ensures optimal system performance
- **Predictive Engine**: Anticipates system and user needs
